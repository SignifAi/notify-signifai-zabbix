# Installation

This document assumes you've followed the directions at
https://www.zabbix.com/download?zabbix=2.2&os_distribution=centos&os_version=7&db=MySQL
for a CentOS 7 installation. It applies to Zabbix version 2.2 but 2.4+
should be quite similar as well.

Determine where your `AlertScriptsPath` is. By default on the CentOS
7/Zabbix 2.2 installation, it's in `/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts`.

Copy send_signifai.py directly into that directory and `chmod 0755` it.
